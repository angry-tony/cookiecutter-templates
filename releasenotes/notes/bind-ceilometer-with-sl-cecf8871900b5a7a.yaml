  Made Ceilometer available only if StackLight deployed.

fixes:
  - The OpenStack Telemetry services depend on StackLight back ends.
    OpenStack Telemetry works only if InfluxDB and Elasticsearch are running.
    Therefore, the OpenStack Telemetry services should not be deployed if
    Stacklight was disabled.
