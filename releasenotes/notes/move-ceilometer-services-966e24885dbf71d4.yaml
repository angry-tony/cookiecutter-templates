    Moved Openstack Telemetry components from ``mdb`` nodes to ``ctl`` nodes
    as there are only the Openstack Telemetry services running on the  ``mdb``
    nodes. The full list of the transfered services:

    * ``ceilometer-agent-central``
    * ``ceilometer-agent-notification``
    * ``ceilometer-api`` (running under Apache)
    * ``aodh-evaluator``
    * ``aodh-listener``
    * ``aodh-notifier``
    * ``aodh-api`` (running under Apache)
    * ``ceilometer_collector``

    To apply the changes for existing deployments:

    #. Change your cluster model according to these fixes.
    #. Update your system model from master.
    #. Update the Keepalived salt-formula.
    #. Stop the services listed above on ``mdb`` nodes:

       .. code-block:: bash

          service ceilometer-agent-central stop
          service ceilometer-agent-notification stop
          service apache2 stop
          service aodh-evaluator stop
          service aodh-listener stop
          service aodh-notifier stop
          service ceilometer_collector stop

    #. Apply the ``ceilometer``, ``aodh``, ``heka.ceilometer_collector`` states on ``ctl`` nodes:

       .. code-block:: bash

          salt 'ctl*' state.sls ceilometer -b 1
          salt 'ctl*' state.sls aodh -b 1
          salt 'ctl*' state.sls heka.ceilometer_collector
