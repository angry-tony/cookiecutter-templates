  - Implemented the ability of the ElasticSearch service to operate in the
    deployments with Stacklight with the DevOps Portal enabled.
    Now, when Cookiecutter generates a Reclass deployment model with both
    StackLight and OSS services enabled, all OSS services are automatically
    switched to use the generic ElasticSearch.
    Namely, the OSS ElasticSearch Docker stack and the GlusterFS volume do not
    start, and the OSS ElasticSearch endpoints and indices switch to the
    StackLight ElasticSearch cluster.
